# arduino-cool
This repository is for my personal learning journey with learning how to use Arduino and a little bit of C++<br>
I don't have much prior experience, especially when it comes to programming, so right now a lot of the concepts I am learning are very new to me. However, so far, it has been really interesting, and I'm having a lot of fun. I definitely want to learn more about coding
# Building - Software
To build and run the files as is, you will need to use the Arduino IDE.<br>
I am using Arduino IDE 2.1.2. The download and documentation can be found on their website [here.](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2)<br>
I am also using the FastLED library, downloaded from within the IDE's library manager.
# Hardware details
This code has *only* been tested with the circuit components that I currently have, meaning that it has **not** been tested with other boards or modules.<br>
Board: [Arduino Nano](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano)<br>
Joystick Module: [keyestudio Joystick Module](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/Ks0008_keyestudio_Joystick_Module) 
# Wiring Instructions 
- Wire Joycon Z or momentary push button between a Digital I/O pin.<br>
- Wire Joycon X and Y pins into seperate Analog pins.<br>
- Wire the joycon positive and ground pins into the Nano's 5V and Ground pins<br>
- So far I've just been using the Arduino's power via the USB connection to the computer, I haven't tested with external power sources yet.
# Disclaimedr
Be safe and smart , I highly reccomend to **not** follow what I am doing especially when it comes to the hardware Because I am definitely not qualified xoxo
